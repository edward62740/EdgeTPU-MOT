 SE05X Import Transient objects
=======================================================================

Before running this example, please run :numref:`se05x-export-transient-objects` :ref:`se05x-export-transient-objects`

This example does following steps:

- Re-Generates a Transient ECC Key at the same location as created by :ref:`se05x-export-transient-objects`

- Tries to verify previously signed data. (This must fail, because key is over-written)

- Imports previously exported key inside the SE.

- Tries to verify previously signed data. (This must be seccessful, because it is the same key)

.. note::

    This example needs File system access and hence it is not applicable for
    embedded platforms.

    The exported files are current working directory.

Visual Studio - Debug settings
=======================================================================

Kindly set debug ``Working Directory`` to ``$(TargetDir)`` in project's debug stettings.
This ensures that the examples :ref:`se05x-export-transient-objects` and
:ref:`se05x-import-transient-objects` work seamlessly.
